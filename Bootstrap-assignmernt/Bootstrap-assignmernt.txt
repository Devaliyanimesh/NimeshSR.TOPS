In Bootstrap, there are several default text settings that you can use to style your content. These include:

.text-muted: This is used to create subtle, muted text that is less prominent than regular text. It is often used for disclaimers, footnotes, or other text that is not the main focus of the page.

.text-primary: This is used to create text that is visually prominent and draws attention to important content. It is often used for headings, titles, or call-to-action buttons.

.text-secondary: This is used to create text that is less prominent than primary text but still serves as an important visual element. It is often used for subheadings or other supporting text.

.text-success: This is used to create text that indicates success or positive feedback. It is often used for confirmation messages or other text that indicates a successful operation.

.text-danger: This is used to create text that indicates danger or error. It is often used for error messages or other text that indicates a failed operation.

.text-warning: This is used to create text that indicates a warning or caution. It is often used for alerts or other text that indicates a potential issue or concern.

.text-info: This is used to create text that provides information or context. It is often used for explanatory text or other information that helps the user understand the content on the page.

In addition to these default text settings, Bootstrap also provides classes for changing the size, weight, and alignment of text, as well as classes for creating text with a background color or border.


4) What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?
Ans>
The grid system in Bootstrap is a responsive layout system that helps developers create flexible and responsive web page layouts that can adjust to different screen sizes and devices. It is based on a 12-column grid system, which can be customized to create layouts with different numbers of columns.

The grid system works by dividing the page into rows and columns. Rows are horizontal groups of columns, and columns are vertical containers that hold content. Each column can be assigned a width between 1 and 12, representing the number of columns it should span. For example, a column with a width of 6 will take up half of the available width in a row.

10) What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?
Ans> In Bootstrap, a card is a flexible and extensible content container. It is a versatile component that can be used to display a wide range of content, such as images, text, links, buttons, and more.
Here's an example of how to create a basic card in Bootstrap:

<div class="card">
  <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>

In this example, the .card class is used to create the card container. The card contains an image (<img> tag) and a body (<div> tag with .card-body class) that includes a title (<h5> tag with .card-title class), some text (<p> tag with .card-text class), and a button (<a> tag with .btn and .btn-primary classes).
